# PPJ_TASK_09

I. Declare a MethodCurrier class that implements two setValue methods that return nothing. The first will accept a simple int variable as a parameter, while the second will take a float variable as a parameter. Both methods will display the values ​​of the supplied variables on the screen with information about the type of the parameter. Next, create an object of the MethodCurrier class and call both methods, providing as parameters literals of the type:
•int
•float
•char
•byte 
On what basis is the decision which method should be used trigger?

II. Define a classNumber with an int field and the methods setValue(assigning the value supplied as a method parameter) and howValue(displaying the value of the field). Then extend the definition of the MethodCurrier class from the previous task with the setValue method that accepts the classNumber as a parameter. Redefine all setValue methods so that they do the following:
• display the state of the variable supplied as a parameter,
• modified the value of the supplied variable,
• displayed the state of the modified variable. 

Create a Person class with the public fields:
•Stringname
•Stringname
•birth introCreate an object of the Person class and store it in the person variable. Use the ability to access public fields of this class and assign them literals or values ​​describing the created person.

IV. Create a constructor for the Person class that will initialize all its fields. Also, create a show method that prints the status of all fields to the screen. Present the operation of both components of the class in the program
